    <p> My hobby is reading interesting and knowledgeable books in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to read such books after completing my home work. I am 10 years old and study in class 6th standard. Now I know very well that reading is very good habit which can make me a knowledgeable person. This hobby can be developed by anyone . Reading books keep one always happy and busy. It is the good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in the life. Thank you </p>
